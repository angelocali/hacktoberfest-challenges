# Hacktoberfest Challenges
Hello there! HacktoberFest is here, but you don't know what to do? Problems too complicated? Fret no more! There will be issues here for you to solve and open PRs and get your sweet approve!

## Rules
[Hacktoberfest rules](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq) apply. Simple as that.

## How to?
1. Go to the [issues](https://github.com/lfmundim/hacktoberfest-challenges/issues) tab and pick a challenge/issue. 
    * comment which language you're using just for me to keep track, but start coding right away! I won't be assigning people to tickets 
3. Fork this repo to your github
4. If there is no folder with the issue name, create one
5. Pick a programming language
6. If there is no folder for that language inside the issue folder, create one
     * if there is one, create a new one and append `_2` or the increment of the latest number
7. Solve the problem! Ideally in _one_ file.
8. Submit a PR and watch your request for updates!

Any questions feel free to reach me :)
